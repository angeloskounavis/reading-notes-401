## The command line

### A command line also knows as a terminal. It is a text based interface system. Basically you are able to enter commands by typing on your keyboard.
### Line 1 presents us with a prompt and after that we enter command.
### Line 2-5: output from running the command
### Line 6: presents us with prompt again

## Shell bash

### "Your terminal is also known as a shell. it helps define how your terminal will behave and look after executing commands for you the most common one is called *bash* which stands for Bourne Again Shell".

## Basic Navigation

### To locate where you are, enter pwd(stands for print working directory).

### To find out what is location you are currently at type ls.

###  To change directories type in cd stands for change directory. 

### The two paths in your terminal are  relative path is a file/directory location to where you currently are in the file system. absolute path is a file/directory location in relation to the root in the file system.

## More about Files

### Everything is a file from a directory to our keyboards. In this case Linux is an extensionless system. But if you want to use normal extension then "a set of 2 - 4 characters after a full stop at the end of a file, which denotes what type of file it is." EX. file.exe, file.txt etc. In this case we can use spaces, quotes and escape characters but we have to be careful cause not everything is valid.

## Manual Page

### "The manual pages are a set of pages that explain every command available on your system including what they do, the specifics of how you run them and what command line arguments they accept. "

## File Manipulation 

### "Linux organises it's file system in a hierarchical way. Over time you'll tend to build up a fair amount of data (storage capacities are always increasing). It's important that we create a directory structure that will help us organise that data in a manageable way. I've seen way too many people just dump everything directly at the base of their home directory and waste a lot of their time trying to find what they are after amongst 100's (or even 1000's) of other files. " In this example the page is using the command mldir which stands for make knew directory and once we hit enter after this command then it will create it.

## Cheat Sheet

### "pwd Where am I in the system, cd [path]Change into the given path or into your home directory, Spaces in names Put whole path in quotes ( " ) or a backslash ( \ ) in front of spaces. etc."
